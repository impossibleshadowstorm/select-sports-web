              <p>
                Select Sports uses <strong>Razorpay</strong> as its payment
                gateway to process transactions securely. Razorpay supports
                various payment methods including UPI (Unified Payments
                Interface), credit/debit cards, and wallets.
              </p>
              <p className='mt-2'>
                UPI is an instant real-time payment system developed by the
                National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a Reserve Bank of
                India (RBI)-regulated entity. If you use UPI for making payments
                through our platform, your UPI transaction information is
                handled in accordance with Razorpay’s privacy policy and terms.
              </p>
              <p className='mt-2'>
                If you are a user based in India, you may see a Play Store badge
                titled <em>&quot;Offers Payments through UPI&quot;</em>. This
                badge indicates that the UPI implementation has been validated
                by NPCI. The badge appears only if the app has opted in via the
                Data Safety form on the Google Play Console.
              </p>

              <p className='mt-2'>
                For more information about UPI or to verify the accreditation
                process, you can contact NPCI directly.
